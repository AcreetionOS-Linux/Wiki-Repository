This guide is written for **beginners** and explains step-by-step how to install:

- **Bottles** – Manage Windows software with Wine in isolated environments.
- **ProtonUp-Qt** – Install and manage Proton-GE versions for Steam and Lutris.
- **Lutris** – Game launcher for multiple platforms.
- **Steam** – Popular gaming platform for Linux, Windows, and Mac.
- **Heroic Games Launcher** – Epic Games, GOG, and Amazon Games launcher for Linux.

We will **only** use the **Pamac GUI** (Add/Remove Software) — **no terminal commands required**.

## 🛠 1. Open Pamac (Add/Remove Software)
1. Click your **application menu**.
2. Search for **"Add/Remove Software"** or **"Pamac"**.

## 🔓 2. Enable AUR (Arch User Repository) Support

Some of the programs we’re installing are only available in the **AUR**, so you need to turn this on.

## 🖥 5. After Installation

Once everything is installed, you can launch them from your applications menu:

- **Steam** – Installs its runtime on first launch; you can log in and start installing games.

## 💡 Tips for Best Results
- Restart your system after installing these apps to make sure everything is set up correctly.
- Keep **AUR updates enabled** so your games and tools stay current.
- Some games may need extra dependencies; Lutris often prompts you to install them automatically.
- For Steam games that need newer Proton versions, open **ProtonUp-Qt** and install the latest Proton-GE, then select it in Steam’s game settings.
