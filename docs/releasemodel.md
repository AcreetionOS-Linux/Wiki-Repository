# AcreetionOS Packages & Release Model

AcreetionOS builds on the incredible foundation provided by [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org). We give full credit to Arch for their upstream work ‚Äî our goal isn‚Äôt to reinvent the wheel, but to refine it and add our own touches of perfection to what they have already established.

We are **not** avoiding or distancing ourselves from the Arch Linux team.  
Our goals simply differ:
- Arch is focused on providing a **pure, rolling-release distribution** in its raw form.
- AcreetionOS aims to provide an **accessible, inclusive, and highly curated version** of Arch with sane defaults, extra polish, and a community-driven approach.

In other words: we **stand on their shoulders**, not apart from them.

## üì¶ Package Repositories

We maintain our **own repositories** in addition to using Arch‚Äôs upstream repos.  
- **Personal Repository:** Contains AcreetionOS-specific packages, customizations, and utilities. It is already listed in your `pacman.conf` when you install AcreetionOS.  
- **Upstream Arch Repos:** Pulled directly from Arch for all standard packages, with our own fixes or improvements applied when needed.

We **host our repositories ourselves** wherever possible. This means:
- Full control over our packages.
- Updates that are intentional, tested, and not rushed.
- Sometimes slower propagation than large corporate distros ‚Äî but this is by design.

## üîÑ Update Model

- **Stable Branch:** Updated **once a month** with curated, tested packages.
- **Testing Branch:** Synced **nightly** from Arch upstream and our own development work. We use this to test packages, catch breakages, and make improvements before they reach stable.

We monitor:
- The [Arch Linux mailing lists](https://lists.archlinux.org)
- Arch‚Äôs forums
- Community reports

‚Ä¶to catch major upstream issues before they impact AcreetionOS users.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Our Reality

AcreetionOS is **small, community-driven, and built by people who care deeply about quality**. Many of us, including the lead maintainer, are on disability.  
This means:
- We work around health limitations ‚Äî but we do not use them as an excuse.
- We prioritize stability, safety, and usefulness over arbitrary deadlines.
- Releases come out **on time for quality**, not on a fixed calendar.

---

## üíø ISO Release Policy

ISO images are released **when they are needed**, not on a rigid schedule.  
Reasons for a new ISO might include:
- Significant system changes
- Major security updates
- Installer improvements

We avoid overcomplicating releases or producing unnecessary ISOs.

---

## üìù Summary

- **Stable branch:** Monthly updates.  
- **Testing branch:** Nightly syncs.  
- **Personal repo:** AcreetionOS packages, pre-configured in `pacman.conf`.  
- **Arch upstream:** We add polish to their excellent foundation while pursuing different goals.  
- **Monitoring:** Mailing lists + forums to catch issues.  
- **Reality:** Small team, self-hosted repos, health limitations ‚Äî but always delivering.  
- **ISO releases:** As needed, not overproduced.
