# AcreetionOS

Welcome to AcreetionOS! We're a community-driven project that aims to provide a stable, reliable, and user-friendly operating system based on Arch Linux. We believe in empowering our users, not serving corporate interests. This means we provide a system that is easy to use, but also powerful and customizable.

## The AcreetionOS Desktop

AcreetionOS features the Cinnamon desktop environment, and it is the only officially supported version. We chose Cinnamon because it provides a classic, intuitive desktop experience that is both familiar and highly customizable. It's stable, mature, and actively developed. We believe it offers the best experience for most users.

We're always working to improve the desktop experience and are committed to providing a polished and consistent user interface.

## Pre-installed Software

AcreetionOS comes with a minimal set of pre-installed applications to get you started:

*   **Firefox:** The default web browser.
*   **Pamac:** A graphical package manager for installing and updating software.
*   **Nemo:** The default file manager.

You can easily install additional software from the official AcreetionOS repositories, ACUR (AcreetionOS AUR) or the Arch User Repository (AUR). We also offer limited Flatpak support. We will do our best to help you.

## System Requirements

To run AcreetionOS, we recommend the following minimum system specifications:

*   **CPU:** 2 cores
*   **RAM:** 2 GB
*   **Storage:** 30 GB of free space

While the system may run on less, these recommendations will ensure a smooth and responsive user experience.

## The Future: ARM and Beyond

We are currently working on an ARM version of AcreetionOS. This is a long-term project, and it is not yet ready for release. We will provide more information as development progresses.

Our focus is, and always will be, on providing a great experience for our users. We're a small team of developers who are passionate about Linux and open source. We're here to help, and we welcome you to our community.
