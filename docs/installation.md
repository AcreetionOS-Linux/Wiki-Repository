# AcreetionOS Installation Guide

Welcome! This page will guide you through installing AcreetionOS. We keep it **as simple as possible** so even if you‚Äôve never installed Linux before, you‚Äôll be fine.  

> **Important:** AcreetionOS currently requires an **active internet connection** to install.

## 1. Choosing Your Installation Method

You have two main ways to get AcreetionOS onto your computer:

### **Option A ‚Äì Use Our USB Flasher Utility** (Recommended)
This is the easiest method. It handles downloading the ISO and writing it to your USB drive for you.

- **Windows**:  
  [Download AcreetionOS USB Flasher for Windows](https://iso.acreetionos.org:8448/Flashing_Utility/dist/AcreetionOS_USB_Flasher_Setup_1.0.0.exe)  
  - Uses **Rufus** under the hood for USB writing because of Windows driver signing.  
  - Just run it, follow the prompts, and you‚Äôre done.

- **Linux**:  
  [Download AcreetionOS USB Flasher for Linux (AppImage)](https://iso.acreetionos.org:8448/Flashing_Utility/dist/AcreetionOS%20USB%20Flasher-1.0.0.AppImage)  
  **Important:**  
  1. Make the AppImage **executable**:  
     ```bash
     chmod +x AcreetionOS\ USB\ Flasher-1.0.0.AppImage
     ```
  2. Install **FUSE** if it‚Äôs not already installed:  
     - **Arch / Manjaro**:  
       ```bash
       sudo pacman -S fuse2
       ```
     - **Debian / Ubuntu / Linux Mint / Pop!_OS**:  
       ```bash
       sudo apt install fuse
       ```
     - **Fedora / RHEL / Rocky / AlmaLinux**:  
       ```bash
       sudo dnf install fuse
       ```
     - **openSUSE**:  
       ```bash
       sudo zypper install fuse
       ```
     - **Gentoo**:  
       ```bash
       sudo emerge sys-fs/fuse
       ```
  *(Runs on almost any Linux system without installation ‚Äî no need for Flathub.)*

### **Option B ‚Äì Manual ISO Method**
If you prefer doing it yourself:

1. Go to [https://acreetionos.org](https://acreetionos.org).
2. Download the ISO you want.  
   - Mirror links are available if the main server is down.
3. Use your own USB writing tool (like Rufus on Windows or `dd` on Linux) to write it to a USB stick.  
   - We have manual instructions right below the download links on our website.

## 2. Installing AcreetionOS

Once your USB is ready:

1. Plug it into the computer you want to install AcreetionOS on.
2. Boot from the USB (this is usually done by pressing **F12**, **F2**, or **Esc** during startup).
3. When AcreetionOS starts, the **installer will automatically pop up**.
4. Go step-by-step through the installer (we use **Calamares**, which is simple).
5. **Internet is required** ‚Äî the installer will download what it needs during setup.
6. Once done, restart, remove the USB, and boot into AcreetionOS.

## 3. What‚Äôs Included by Default

- **Firefox** web browser (ready to go after install).
- **Pamac** ‚Äî a friendly software store where you can install and remove apps without touching the terminal.
- Basic tools for everyday use.

---

## 4. Installing Extra Apps

Want Google Chrome or something else? You have options:

- **AUR (Arch User Repository)** ‚Äî a huge collection of community-maintained software.
- You can enable AUR support directly in Pamac:
  1. Open Pamac.
  2. Go to **Preferences** (you may need your password).
  3. Enable **AUR**.
  4. Search for your app (e.g., ‚Äúgoogle-chrome‚Äù) and click install.

## 7. If You‚Äôre the ‚ÄúI Read the Manual‚Äù Type

Some people like to dive into **documentation** instead of asking questions.  
If that‚Äôs you, check out:  
üìö [AcreetionOS Wiki ‚Äì Problems & Fixes](https://wiki.acreetionos.org/en/latest/problems/)  

Just know‚Ä¶ the wiki is written in the **classic old-school Linux style**, which is great if you like scrolling through text walls.  
Most newer users these days just:
- Ask on Discord.
- Or use AI to get an answer in 10 seconds.  

But hey, if you‚Äôre a ‚Äúmanual and coffee‚Äù person ‚Äî we love you too. ‚ù§Ô∏è
