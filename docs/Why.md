# Why AcreetionOS Exists

We started AcreetionOS because something needed to change.

Computers should work for you, not against you. But for many people, the options out there aren’t great anymore. Windows and macOS have become heavy, slow, and full of tracking you never asked for—especially on older or lower-end machines. They take up more space, demand more resources, and in many cases, quietly collect your data.

We don’t want that.  
Not just because we care about your privacy, but because **tracking you would cost us more to run**. It’s not worth it, and it’s not who we are.

## A Family Project with a Purpose
AcreetionOS is built and maintained by a small group of people working closely together like family—because in many ways, we are family.  
Natalie and Darren lead the development. Adran helps write our clear, easy-to-follow documentation. Benji collaborates with us to improve the experience for everyone.

We know some people hear “family project” and worry it means unprofessional. Not here. To us, it means **we take things personally**—we care deeply about what we’re making and about the people using it. We treat every user like part of our extended family.

## The Problem
Arch Linux is powerful, but it’s not friendly to new users.  
Most of it starts in a **command-line environment**, and while some people enjoy that, it’s not the way most people want to use their computers. If people are going to adopt an operating system, it has to be easy to install, easy to use, and easy to live with.

It should be:
- A place where you can choose to learn more if you want to, or simply relax and watch your shows.
- A place where you can easily get the software you need without digging through manuals.
- A place where you’re not afraid of breaking things just by trying something new.
- A place where you **don’t freak out on first boot**—you just know it works.
- A place where questions are welcomed and appreciated, not dismissed.

## The AcreetionOS Solution
- **Lightweight and fast** so even older machines can run smoothly.
- **Private by design** — no tracking, no hidden data collection.
- **Stable and tested** before updates reach you.
- **Modern look and feel** without the complexity or bloat.
- **Made for people, not corporations** — everything we build is shaped by community feedback.

## Always Improving
We work every day to make AcreetionOS better. We use automation to save time and improve quality, so we can focus on helping people. One day, we hope to make the world a better place—**one line of code at a time**.

## Inclusive and Respectful
Our community is open to everyone. We welcome people of **all backgrounds, skills, and experiences**.  
It doesn’t matter where you come from, what you believe, or what challenges you face—**you have a place here**. Disabilities, limitations, and differences don’t exclude anyone from our community.  

The only thing we ask is that we leave politics at the door.  
This way, we can all collaborate in a **respectful, fun, and entertaining environment**—where the focus is on building something amazing together.

## Non-Traditional Workflows
We don’t force everyone into a corporate-style model. People work best in different ways, and we respect that.  
Some of us are neurodivergent, some of us have unique working habits, and we believe it’s unfair to demand everyone fit into a rigid mold. Our workflow adapts to **each person’s strengths and needs**—because we aren’t corporate, we are inclusive, and we are a community.

We believe that when people can work in the way that’s best for them, they do their best work—and that benefits everyone who uses AcreetionOS.

## Respecting Everyone’s Time
Time is valuable—for our users and our developers. We respect it.  
We design AcreetionOS so that users don’t have to waste hours fixing problems or hunting down answers. And we respect our developers’ time by avoiding unnecessary bureaucracy or pressure.  

Our standards are high, but our appreciation for the people involved is even higher. We give **absolute leniency** to our contributors, because we know they are giving us something even more valuable than code: their time, energy, and heart.

## What We Offer
- **A clear, easy-to-read wiki** for guidance.
- **Our own GitLab** for projects and collaboration.
- **A private Nextcloud** for file sharing and teamwork.
- **A focus on the future** with tools that embrace AI where it’s useful.

> We started with Arch Linux. We loved its power and flexibility, but we saw how hard it was for new users to get started. So we built AcreetionOS—a system that keeps the best parts of Arch but makes it welcoming, stable, and ready for anyone to use from the very first boot.
