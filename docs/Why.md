# The AcreetionOS Philosophy

We created AcreetionOS to address a growing problem in the world of desktop operating systems. Many modern OSes have become bloated, intrusive, and restrictive. They consume excessive resources, collect user data without explicit consent, and often remove control from the user in the name of simplicity. We believe there is a better way.

Our philosophy is rooted in the principles of the Arch Linux community: simplicity, modernity, pragmatism, user centrality, and versatility. We aim to provide a powerful and flexible system that puts the user back in control.

## Why Not Just Use Arch Linux?

Arch Linux is a fantastic distribution for those who want to build a system from the ground up. However, the installation process and the need for manual configuration can be a significant barrier for many users. The learning curve is steep, and not everyone has the time or inclination to tackle it.

AcreetionOS bridges this gap. We provide a curated, out-of-the-box experience built on a stable Arch Linux base. You get the power and flexibility of Arch, but with a user-friendly installer, sane defaults, and a selection of well-configured desktop environments. We do the initial heavy lifting so you can get straight to using your system.

## Our Core Principles

*   **User-Centric:** The system should adapt to the user, not the other way around. We provide the tools and the flexibility for you to create a system that fits your workflow. We don't impose a specific way of working or lock you into a particular ecosystem.

*   **Minimalism and Simplicity:** We believe in a minimal base install. We don't ship with a plethora of pre-installed applications that you may never use. You start with a clean slate and add only what you need. This results in a faster, more responsive system.

*   **Stability and Reliability:** While we are a rolling-release distribution, we prioritize stability. We maintain our own repository of packages, which are tested before being released to users. Our usually every two-week predictable update schedule ensures that you get the latest software without the constant risk of breakage.

*   **Privacy and Transparency:** Your computer is your own. We do not collect any telemetry or user data. Our development process is open and transparent, and our source code is available for anyone to inspect.

## A Community-Driven Project

AcreetionOS is not a corporate entity. We are a community of developers, contributors, and users who are passionate about creating a better desktop operating system. We do not accept monetary donations. Instead, we establish resources with other organizations, such as universities, to offer services for our end-users. We also self-host what we can, like our repositories, for cost reasons. This means our only motivation is to serve our users.

We believe in the power of collaboration and welcome contributions from everyone. Whether you are a seasoned developer, a documentation writer, or a user who wants to report a bug, you have a place in our community. Together, we can build something truly special.
