## üîí Privacy Reminder: Using Redirect Services

When you include **links or email addresses** in any template:
- Please use a **privacy-friendly redirect service** like:
  - [https://t.ly](https://t.ly)
  - [https://tinyurl.com](https://tinyurl.com)
  - [https://anon.to](https://anon.to) (for anonymized redirects)
- This helps **protect your personal IP address and metadata** when people click your links.
- It also ensures old links can be updated in the future without editing old posts.

**Example ‚Äî Instead of:**
```
https://github.com/username/myrepo
```
**Use:**
```
https://t.ly/example
```

For emails, use a disposable/alias email:
**Example ‚Äî Instead of:**
```
myrealemail@gmail.com
```
**Use:**
```
contact-me@example.alias.simplelogin.com
```
