# AcreetionOS: GNOME Edition (Discontinued)

The GNOME edition of AcreetionOS has been discontinued and is no longer maintained. This decision was made due to the GNOME desktop environment's transition to a Wayland-only display server, which we believe is not yet ready for all users.

## Why was it discontinued?

The transition to Wayland by the GNOME project has been a significant undertaking. While we appreciate the effort to modernize the Linux desktop, we feel that Wayland is not yet mature enough to provide the stable and reliable experience that we want for our users.

Furthermore, maintaining a fork of GNOME with Xorg support (Xlibre) would require a significant amount of development resources that we, as a small community-driven project, simply do not have.

For these reasons, we have decided to retire the GNOME edition and focus our development efforts on the Cinnamon edition, as well as the upcoming ARM version of AcreetionOS.

## What are the alternatives?

We recommend that users who are looking for a modern and feature-rich desktop experience try the [AcreetionOS: Cinnamon Edition](AcreetionOS-Cinnamon.md). The Cinnamon desktop provides a more traditional workflow that is both familiar and highly customizable.

All of our development work is now focused on the Cinnamon version, and we are confident that it will provide a great experience for our users.

We thank you for your understanding and support.
