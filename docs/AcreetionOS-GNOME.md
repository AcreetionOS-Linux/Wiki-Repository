# Welcome to AcreetionOS GNOME — Made for Mac Users

AcreetionOS GNOME is designed especially for people who love Mac computers. It feels familiar and easy to use.

## What Makes It Special

- **Touch Gestures Like Mac:**  
  It uses a tool called **touchegg** to give you the same finger movements on your touchpad that you use on a Mac, so things feel natural.

- **Fingerprint and Face Recognition:**  
  The apps for logging in with your fingerprint or face are finished and will be ready in the next version. This helps keep your computer safe and quick to access.

- **Gemeni Connection (Coming Soon):**  
  We’re working on adding **Gemeni**, which will help your computer talk to other services more easily.

- **Modern Look and Feel:**  
  AcreetionOS GNOME uses new technology to give you a clean, fresh look that works perfectly with dark colors, which is easier on your eyes.

- **All Your Favorite Apps:**  
  It comes with the same set of useful programs as our other version called Cinnamon, so you have everything you need right away.
