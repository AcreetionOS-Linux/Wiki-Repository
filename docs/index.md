## A System That Keeps Getting Smarter

We believe your computer should work *with* you, not against you. That’s why we’re integrating the latest in smart authentication features:

- **Fingerprint sensor support** – unlock your system just like your phone  
- **FaceID-style login** – log in by simply looking at the screen  
- **Future support for secure identity features** – we’re exploring technologies like **Gemeni over IPA**, a modern way to manage identity across apps, while respecting your privacy

AcreetionOS is progressive not just in technology, but in philosophy. We build with inclusion, transparency, and long-term freedom in mind—not corporate control.

## Built to Be Stable, Not Rushed

While some systems constantly push updates that break things, AcreetionOS takes a different path. We update **once a month**—carefully and predictably—so your system stays stable and smooth. You’re never forced to upgrade in the middle of your day, and you’re never left with something that no longer works.

## Flavors That Fit Your Style

We understand that not everyone uses their computer the same way, so we give you choices:

- **Cinnamon Edition** – modern but familiar, great for switching from Windows  
- **GNOME Edition** – sleek and focused, great for getting things done  
- **XFCE Edition [StormOS]** – ultra-lightweight, for older computers or performance fans, and those wanting an experimental experience.  

No matter the edition, AcreetionOS stays fast, stable, and easy to use.

## More Than an Operating System—A Movement

Whether you’re new to computing or just tired of how complicated it’s become, AcreetionOS is your chance to reset and experience what modern computing *should* feel like.
