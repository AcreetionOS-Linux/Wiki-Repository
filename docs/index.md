# AcreetionOS: Your System, Your Rules.

Welcome to AcreetionOS. We're a community of developers and users who believe that your operating system should serve you, not the other way around. We started this project because we were tired of the bloat, the telemetry, and the corporate agendas that drive mainstream OS development. Our philosophy is simple: build a fast, clean, and reliable system that puts you in control.

This wiki is the heart of our documentation. It's written by us—the developers—and by community members like you. It's here to help you get the most out of AcreetionOS, whether you're a seasoned Linux user or just starting your journey.

## What is AcreetionOS?

AcreetionOS is a Linux distribution built on a stable Arch Linux base. We take the power and flexibility of Arch and pair it with a curated, user-friendly experience. Our goal is to provide a system that is:

*   **Fast and Lightweight:** We ship a minimal set of packages by default. No bloatware, no unnecessary services running in the background.
*   **Stable and Reliable:** We're based on a snapshot of the Arch Linux repositories, which we test and stabilize before releasing updates. This means you get a rolling-release model without the constant risk of breakage. We release updates once a month, on a predictable schedule.
*   **User-Focused:** We believe in sane defaults and a system that works out of the box. We also believe in choice. That's why we offer different desktop environments, so you can pick the one that best suits your workflow.
*   **Private and Secure:** We don't collect your data. We don't track your usage. We believe that your computer is your own. We're also working on integrating modern authentication methods like fingerprint and facial recognition, implemented in a way that respects your privacy.

## For the Community, By the Community

AcreetionOS is a labor of love. We're not a corporation; we're a team of volunteers who are passionate about building a better operating system. We do not accept monetary donations. Instead, we establish resources with other organizations, such as universities, to offer services for our end-users. We also self-host what we can, like our repositories, for cost reasons. This means our only incentive is to build the best system we can for you.

We believe in transparency and open collaboration. Our development process is open, and we encourage our users to get involved. Whether it's by reporting bugs, contributing to this wiki, or packaging new software, there are many ways to help shape the future of AcreetionOS.

## Desktop Environments

We currently focus our development efforts on the Cinnamon edition of AcreetionOS:

*   **Cinnamon Edition:** A modern, feature-rich desktop environment that provides a familiar and comfortable user experience.

We also have an experimental **XFCE Edition (StormOS)** for those who want a lightweight, no-frills experience, or for those with older hardware. An ARM version is under development, but it is not ready and is a distant prospect.
