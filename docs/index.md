# AcreetionOS: Your System, Your Rules.

Welcome to AcreetionOS. We're a community of developers and users who believe that your operating system should serve you, not the other way around. We started this project because we were tired of the bloat, the telemetry, and the corporate agendas that drive mainstream OS development. Our philosophy is simple: build a fast, clean, and reliable system that puts you in control.

This wiki is the heart of our documentation. It's written by us—the developers—and by community members like you. It's here to helping you get the most out of AcreetionOS, whether you're a seasoned Linux user or just starting your journey.

## What is AcreetionOS?

AcreetionOS is a Linux distribution built on a stable Arch Linux base. We take the power and flexibility of Arch and pair it with a curated, user-friendly experience. Our goal is to provide a system that is:

*   **Fast and Lightweight:** We ship a minimal set of packages by default. No bloatware, no unnecessary services running in the background.
*   **Stable and Reliable:** We're based on a snapshot of the Arch Linux repositories, which we test and stabilize before releasing updates. This means you get a rolling-release model without the constant risk of breakage. We release updates once we know packages work on a ordinarily, two week schedule, but at times, we release a "hotfix" package release to avoid breakage.
*   **User-Focused:** We believe in sane defaults and a system that works out of the box. We also believe in choice. That is why we do not block AUR support, Flatpak support, and offer the ACUR.
*   **Private and Secure:** We don't collect your data. We don't track your usage. We believe that your computer is your own.

## For the Community, By the Community

AcreetionOS is a labor of love. We're not a corporation; we're a team of volunteers who are passionate about building a better operating system. We purposefully avoid accepting physical donations, and choose to accept donation, via establishing partnerships. By doing this, it allows for us to incentivise help you without considering corporate finangling.

We believe in transparency and open collaboration. Our development process is open, and we encourage our users to get involved. Whether it's by reporting bugs, contributing to this wiki, or packaging new software, there are many ways to help shape the future of AcreetionOS.
